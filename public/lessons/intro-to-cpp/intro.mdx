# Why C++?

Many of the examples you will find on O(fast) are written in C++.  This is for a few reasons.
C++ is a fast language since it has access to many low-level operations.
It also has a wide variety of built-in data structures useful in competitive programming.
You also get the choice to manage memory yourself, similar to C, but without a lot of the nuance that comes with programming in C.
Overall, we believe that coding in C++ is beneficial in your journey of competitive programming.
If you donâ€™t know much about C++, this section will help you learn the basics.

# Template

The first thing you should do when writing code in C++ is make sure that you have a template to work with.
This is the basic structure that your template should follow:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

`bits/stdc++.h` is an all-encompassing library that contains almost all of the data structures that we use in
competitive programming.(WARNING for Mac users, this is not included in your G++ compiler and you may have to create the header file yourself)

`using namespace std;`  allows us to have access to many builtin functions that make competitive programming easier.
It also allows us to write more concise code.

`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`
`cin.tie(NULL);`
These two lines are used for fast i/o.  How they work is not too important, but we include it in our programs in case
we are outputting a lot of information, and this speeds it up drastically.

We `return 0;` at the end of the program because it is the standard way of exiting the main function.  If you choose to
return a non-zero value, you may run into runtime errors on many judges.


# Compiling and Running

C++ code needs to be compiled before running.  To do this you should use `g++ hello.cpp` at the command line where `hello.cpp` is the name of your file.
To run the program on Linux or Mac use `./a.out`.  If you are using Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl).
You can also name your program something else using `-o` like so: `g++ hello.cpp -o hello`.  Then to run this program you run `./hello`.
