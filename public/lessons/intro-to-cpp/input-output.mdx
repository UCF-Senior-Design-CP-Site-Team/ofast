# Input and Output
The first thing you need to know when learning any programming language is how to take input from the user, and output some information.
This section goes over i/o (input and output)

## Output
To output in C++, you have to use the `std::cout` command.
Because we have `using namespace std;` in our template, this can be shortened to `cout`.
The output in C++ automatically knows what variable types you are using and will take care of that for us.
To output any variable, say `x`, you can type `cout << x`.

Here is an example on how you can make a program to print out "Hello, World!".

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    cout << “Hello, World!\n”

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that when outputting in C++, you have to specify a new line at the end of your output with `\n`.
Another way we can do an end-line character is with `endl`.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    cout << “Hello, World!” << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

`endl` allows us to flush our output (empties the buffer) and places a new line character at the end of your output.
This is very important when debugging since it guarentees that the output prints when expected.

If you want to output multiple variables, `x,y,z`, you would format it like this: `cout << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;`.
Notice that you have to put spaces in between the variables, since C++ does not do this for us.

### Floating point output
Sometimes, problems will want you to output a floating point value to a certain degree of accuracy.  The default output that C++ has is typically not enough.
To help with this, we have to add `fixed` and `setprecision(VALUE)` (where `VALUE` is the number of digits after the decimal point) to our output.

Here, we take in 3 doubles, and output them with 9 digits after the decimal point.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    double x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y >> z;

    cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

You only need to put `fixed` and `setprecision(VALUE)` once, and it will apply to the rest of the output.

## Input

When taking input in C++, we use a similar command to output, `cin` to take in variables from the command line.
`cin` also knows how to handle different variable types (so long as there is whitepace between the values).
In the following example, we take in an integer, a string, and a double, and simply output them.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int i;
    string s;
    double x;
    cin >> i >> s >> x;
    cout << i << " " << s << " " << x << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that when using `cin`, the arrows go in the opposite direction of `cout`.
One way you can remember which one to use is that `cin` is putting the value into the variable, so it is pointing at it.
`cout` is recieving the variables for output, so the arrows point at `cout`.

### Taking input by lines

One area you may have difficulty in when starting to work with C++ is when there are important whitespace characters in the input.
To deal with this, we have to take the input in a slightly different way, using the `getline()` function.
This function takes in two variables, the source of the input, and a string to place the input into.
In our case, we will always use `cin` for the input, and whatever our string's name is.

The code below scans in strings until there is no more input, and outputs them while preserving their whitespace characters.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namesapce std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    string s;
    while (getline(cin, s)) {
        cout << s << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Note that the `getline()` function does **not** place the `\n` at the end of your string.
