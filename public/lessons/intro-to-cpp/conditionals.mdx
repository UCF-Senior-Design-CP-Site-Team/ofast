# Conditional statements

## If statements

If statements are very important to use in any application of programming.
In C++, if statements are formatted pretty standard, as shown below.

This program takes in an integer and outputs if it is our favorite number (11), least favorite number (6), or neither.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namesapce std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);

    int value;
    cin >> value;

    if (value == 11) {
        cout << "That's my favorite number!!!!! :)))))" << endl;
    } else if (value == 6) {
        cout << "That is my least favorite number >:(" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "That number is okay I guess :/" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that we use ``==`` to check equality.  It is very important that you do **not** use a single `=` since this will assign a variable instead of checking its value.
If you are checking a certain number, it is good practice to have the number value on the left side like so `if (1 == value)`, since this will throw an error when compiling.

You can also combine several logic statements using `||` which is a logical **or** statement, and `&&` **and** which is the logical and statement.
If you wanted your if statement to trigger on only values `1` and `3`, you could write `if (value == 1 || value == 3)`.

If the code after your if statement is only one line, you can choose to omit the curly braces, however this is not good practice, especially when debugging.

## While loops

While loops are a type of loop that continually get called until some condition is met.
They are similar to if statements, except they execute until the condition is met, whereas if statements are only called once.

Here we have a countdown program as an example.


```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namesapce std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);

    int i = 10;
    
    while (i > 0) {
        cout << i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Like if statements, you can omit the curly braces if there is only one line, but again this is bad practice.


## For loops

For loops are a type of loop that iterate a certain number of times.
They follow the structure of: `for(initialize; condition; update)`
The for loops in C++ are written in a standard way as shown below.

This example prints out the numbers 1 through 10.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namesapce std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        cout << i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that we start `i` at 1 and stop the loop when we reach `10`.  You can create and assign any variable here, and choose any condition you would like it to stop on.
You can also increment `i` by more using `i += x` where `x` is your value.

## For each loops

With many data structures, you can also use what is called a for each loop, which automatically assigns a variable and allows for a bit cleaner code.

Here, we loop through a vector of ints.
```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namesapce std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);

    vector<int> numbers(10)
    for (auto &number : numbers) {
        cout << number << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Nested loops
You can also nest loops (put them inside of each other) as shown below.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            cout << i << " " << j << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Loops are a powerful tool in programming, so you should get used to using them.
