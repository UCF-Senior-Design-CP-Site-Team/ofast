# Data types

When programming, we have many different types of data we can use, for example, strings, integers, floats, arrays etc.
Here we are going to introduce these few, but there are many more data structures that are not built in that we make use of in competitive programming.

## Numbers

There are two types of numbers that we use in programming, integers and floats.  Integers are the numbers you can count, or whole numbers.
Here are the types of integers used in C++, how many bits they use, and their largest/smallest values.

| Data Type            | # of Bits | Min Value                  | Max Value                  | Use Case                                                              |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `int`                | 32        | -2,147,483,648             | 2,147,483,647              | When working with "average" sized numbers                             |
| `short`              | 16        | -32,768                    | 32,767                     | Don't                                                                 |
| `long long`          | 64        | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807  | When numbers can overflow an integer, but won't overflow `long longs` |
| `unsigned int`       | 32        | 0                          | 4,294,967,295              | Most of the time you won't need this                                  |
| `unsigned long long` | 64        | 0                          | 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 | If you need just a few more bits than `long long`                     |

If you are ever getting a runtime error, it might be worth trying to switch your `int` values to `long long` values just in case overflow is causing your issue.

We also have floating point numbers.  These are for values that may not be whole, but they can cover a much larger range of values.
The biggest difficulty when working with floating point values is that they are not very accurate on computers, but by increasing the number of bits used, we can get more accurate values.

<p align="center">
| Data Type     | # of Bits | Accuracy |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| `float`       | 32        | Lowest   |
| `double`      | 64        | Decent   |
| `long double` | 128       | Best     |
</p>

In general, when working with floating point values, you will want to work with `double` and `long double` since they provide the most accuracy.

## Booleans
Booleans are a value that can be either true or false and are very useful in conditional statements.
To declare a boolean you can use `bool NAME`.
One thing to note about this is that booleans are integers with a different type name, so they still use 32 bits.
Integers can also be used as booleans if you choose to do so.

## Characters

Characters are a data structure for representing characters that are usually typable or have some significant meaning.
They coorespond with ASCII values as shown below.  They typically use 8  bits.

```console

```

## Strings

Strings are a data structure for a list of characters.
They work as a vector of characters (which we will get into soon) and are very powerful for programming.

## Arrays
Every data type can have an array created for it, for example an integer array can be declared with `int[SIZE] numbers;` where `SIZE` is the size of your array.
These are used to store many of one data type, and can be multi dimensional by adding another set of brackets like so `int[N][M] table`.
The biggest issue when using arrays is that their size must be fixed, but they are faster than vectors.

## Vectors
Vectors are dynamic arrays, similar to `ArrayList` in java.  Their size expands as they grow and you can make vectors of every type.
To make a vector of integers, you would use `vector<int> numbers(n);`  Where `n` is optional and displays the size of the vector you will be using (which can still be expanded upon).
To get the size of a vector named numbers you would use `numbers.size()`.
To add to the end of a vector, you can use `numbers.push_back(x)` where `x` is the value you are appending.
You can access vectors like arrays by using `numbers[i]` where `i` is the 0-based index of the array.
To make a multidimensional vector, it is a little complicated but you get used to it.  `vector<vector<int>> table(n, vector<int>(m));`.
This gives us an $n \times m$ array.

There are many more things you can do with vectors, but these are just the basics to get you started.

Hopefully now you know a bit more about C++, and can start practicing.
As with all programming languages, the best thing you can do to learn is to practice, so have fun!
