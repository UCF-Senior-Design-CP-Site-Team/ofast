# Data types

When programming, we have many different types of data we can use, for example, strings, integers, floats, arrays etc.
Here we are going to introduce these few, but there are many more data structures that are not built in that we make use of in competitive programming.

## Numbers

There are two types of numbers that we use in programming, integers and floats.  Integers are the numbers you can count, or whole numbers.
Here are the types of integers used in C++, how many bits they use, and their largest/smallest values.
- `int` is the most common declaration for integers, it uses 32 bits, has a max value of 2147483647, and a min value of -2147483648.
- `short` is not recommended to be used, it has 16 bits, a max value of 32767, and a min value of -32768
- `long long` is good for if you are working with larger values, it uses 64 bits, has a max value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, and a min value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- `unsigned int` also uses 32 bits, but it does not have negative values, it has a max value of 4,294,967,295, and a min value of 0.
- `unsigned long long` uses 64 bits and does not inlcude negative values, it has a max value of 18446744073709551615, and a min value of 0.

If you are ever getting a runtime error, it might be worth trying to switch an `int` to a `long long` just in case overflow is causing your issue.

We also have floating point numbers.  These are for values that may not be whole, but they can cover a much larger range of values.
- `float` use 32 bits and have a max value of 3.402823466 * $10^{38}$ and a min value of 1.175494351 * $10^{-38}$
- `double` use 64 bits and are the most common way of declaring floating point values, they have a max value of 1.79769313486231570 * $10^{308}$ and a min value of 2.2250738585072014 * $10^{-308}$
- `long double` use 128 bits and can be used for mor accurate calculations,  they have a max value of 1.7976931348623157 * $10^{308}$ and their minimum value depends on the system.

## Characters

Characters are a data structure for representing characters that are usually typable or have some significant meaning.  They coorespond with ASCII values as shown below.
