## Planning a Solution

When looking at a new problem on $O(fast)$ or in a programming contest, take a careful look at the time limit and the input specification to determine what time complexity will be necessary to solve it.

A helpful rule-of-thumb in competitive programming is that computers can perform around $10^8$ operations in a second.
You'll gain a better intuition for how much you can push this limit as you solve more problems.

On O(fast), problems can be submitted in C++, Java, and Python. Of the three languages, C++ runs the fastest.
Java runs a bit slower than C++, and Python runs a bit slower than Java. Most problems on O(fast) will pass in all 3 languages as
long as the Big-O of the solution is small enough. However, programming contest on websites like Codeforces and Kattis won't be as forgiving.
It's important to consider the performance of a programming language when deciding to learn it. 


Take a look at this screenshot from the Two-Sum problem on O(fast):

In this problem, the array's length (n) can be up to $10^4$. If our time limit is 2 seconds, we would need to find an algorithm that performs $2*10^8$ operations or less.

<table width = "550px">
    <tr><th>Big-O</th><th>Number of Operations</th><th>Estimated Runtime</th></tr>
    <tr><td>$O(n)$</td><td>$\approx10^4$</td><td>\< 1 millisecond</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$O(nlogn)$</td><td>$\approx 10^5$</td><td>1 millisecond</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$O(n^2)$</td><td>$\approx10^8$</td><td>1 second</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$O(n^3)$</td><td>$\approx10^{12}$</td><td>3 hours</td></tr>
</table>

For this constraint, an solution that is $O(n^2)$ or better will work. One solution could be to check every pair of indices.
Can you think of a faster way?
