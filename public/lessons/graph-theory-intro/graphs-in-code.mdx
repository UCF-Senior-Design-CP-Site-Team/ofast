# Representing Graphs in Code

Once we have a conceptual understanding of a problem as a graph, we need to represent the graph in
code. There are two common ways to represent graphs in code: **adjacency list** and 
**adjacency matrix**. Each representation has its ups and downs, and the choice of representation
will depend on the problem at hand. However, in general, adjacency lists are preferred for sparse
graphs (few edges), while adjacency matrices are preferred for dense graphs.

Here is an example graph to help illustrate the two representations:

<Graph
  id="graph"
  data={{
    nodes: [
      { id: 0 }, 
      { id: 1 }, 
      { id: 2 }, 
      { id: 3 },
    ],
    edges: [
      { source: 0, target: 1},
      { source: 0, target: 2},
      { source: 0, target: 3},
      { source: 1, target: 2},
      { source: 2, target: 3},
    ]
  }}
/>

## Adjacency List

An adjacency list is an array of lists. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices in
the graph. Let the array be `adj`. An entry `adj[u]` is a list that contains all the vertices that
are adjacent to vertex `u`. For weighted graphs, the list can contain pairs of vertices and weights.

Here is the adjacency list representation for the graph shown above:


- $0: 1, 2, 3 $
- $1: 0, 2$
- $2: 0, 1, 3$
- $3: 0, 2$

## Adjacency Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size $V \times V$ where $V$ is the number of vertices in the
graph. Let the 2D array be `adj`. If there is an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$, then `adj[u][v]`
will be `1`. Otherwise, it will be `0`. For weighted graphs, `adj[u][v]` can be the weight of the
edge between vertices $u$ and $v$. Here is the adjacency matrix for the same graph as above:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>
