# Introduction to Graph Theory

If you have ever seen a problem that involves a set of entities and establishes relationships
between them, you have seen a problem that can potentially be solved using Graph Theory. Graphs are 
a fundamental data structure in Computer Science and can be used to model a wide variety of problem 
scenarios. Given a graphical interpretation of a problem, we can take advantage of many graph-based 
algorithms available to come up with a solution. Some noteworthy examples of classical graph theory
problems include graph traversal, finding shortest-paths, topological sorting, and many more. This 
makes Graph Theory a fascinating and essential topic to master when it comes to Competitive 
Programming.

## Terminology

Formally, a graph can be defined as $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of
edges connecting these vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected. Directional edges only allow
traversal in one direction. Edges can be weighted or unweighted. A weighted edge has an associated
value that can represent a cost, distance, or any other value.
