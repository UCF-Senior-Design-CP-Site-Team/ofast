# Introduction to Graph Theory

Formally, a graph can be defined as $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of
edges connecting these vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected. Directional edges only allow
traversal in one direction. Edges can be weighted or unweighted. A weighted edge has an associated
value that can represent a cost, distance, or any other value.
