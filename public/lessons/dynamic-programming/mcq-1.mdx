## Quiz: Base Cases
<MCQBlock
  question="In the previous example, what would be the base case of the recursive function?"
  answerOptions={[
    '$F(0) = 1$',
    '$F(0) = 2$',
    '$F(n) = 2 * F(n)$',
    '$F(n) = 2 * F(n) - 1$',

  hint="At what point would the recursive function terminate? What would it return?"
  explanation="The recursion stops when there are no iterations remaining. In this case there are two pieces of chocolate since that is the initial state of the problem."
