## Quiz: Types of D.P.
<FITBBlock hint="Recall the difference between **memoization** and **tabulation**">
    Often referred to as "top-down D.P.", <FITBBlank correctAnswer="memoization"/> is the process of recursing through subproblems and storing the result to avoid repeated computation.

    On the other hand, <FITBBlank correctAnswer="tabulation"/> (also referred to as "bottom-up D.P.") iteratively builds up solutions from the base case.
