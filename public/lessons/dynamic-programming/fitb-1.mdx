<FITBBlock hint="Derive the nth term using the n-1th term">
    Alice and Bob are playing a game. In this game Alice starts off with 2 pieces of chocolate. She is going to magically double the amount of chocolate she has and give it all to Bob. Bob is then going to eat 1 piece of chocolate and give the remaining pieces back to Alice so that she can repeat this process. Determine how many pieces of chocolate Alice will have after $n$ iterations of this process.
        
        If $n = 0: f(n) = 2$
        
        If $n > 0: f(n) =  $<FITBBlank correctAnswer="2 * f(n - 1)"/> $- 1$.
