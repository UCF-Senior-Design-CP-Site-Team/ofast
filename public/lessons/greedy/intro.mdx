# Introduction to Greedy Algorithms in Competitive Programming

## What are Greedy Algorithms?
Competitive programming often involves solving complex problems under tight time constraints. Greedy algorithms are a fundamental technique used to design efficient and effective solutions in this context. A greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope that these choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

The key idea behind greedy algorithms is to make the best possible decision at each stage of the problem, without reconsidering or undoing previous choices. Unlike dynamic programming, which stores and reuses solutions to subproblems, greedy algorithms focus on making immediate decisions to maximize some objective function.

## Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms exhibit several common characteristics:

### 1. Greedy Choice Property
At each step, a greedy algorithm makes the choice that appears to be the best at the moment. This choice is determined based on a specific criterion, such as a certain element having a greater value.

### 2. Optimal Substructure
A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

### 3. No Backtracking
Greedy algorithms do not revisit or revise decisions once made. They move forward without reconsidering past choices, making them efficient for solving problems with a clear structure.
