## Takeaways and Resources

Big-O is a simple estimate of an algorithm's performance, common in competitive programming and in the workplace.\
When brainstorming a solution to a problem:
1. Assume that you can run $\approx 10^8 $ operations in a second.
2. Determine your solution's runtime before writing the code.
3. Ignore non-dominant terms and constant multipliers when estimating the Big-O.

There are a lot more technical details that can be discussed about Big-O that we won't cover here.
- Big-O has a sophisticated mathematical definition, which can used to write proofs about the growth of functions.
- Big-O has two siblings, Big-$\Omega$, and Big-$\Theta$
- Big-O can be used to discuss the memory usage of an algorithm, also called Space Complexity
