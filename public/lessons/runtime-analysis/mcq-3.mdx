### Quiz : Runtime Analysis
<MCQBlock question = "A helpful assumption to make in competitive programming is that computers can perform around $10^8$ operations in a second.\
You came up with an algorithm to solve a problem on ofast. Its time complexity is $O(n^3)$. Which is the largest input size ($n$) you could support if the program must run in under a second?"
answerOptions ={[
'$n = 30$',
'$n = 300$',
'$n = 3000$',
'$n = 30,000$']}
optionVerdicts = {[false, true, false, false]}
hint = "If the input size is $n$, then the algorithm will perform $\approx{n^3}$ operations."
explanation= "$300^3 = 27,000,000$, or $2.7*10^7$, which is safely under $10^8$.\
However,\
$3000^3 = 27,000,000,000$, or $2.7*10^{10}$ which far exceeds $10^8$ "
