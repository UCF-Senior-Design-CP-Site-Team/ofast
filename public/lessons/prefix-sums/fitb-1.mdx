<FITBBlock 
    hint="What are the two indices from the `prefix` array?" 
    explanation="To get the range between $[a, b]$, the indices are $b$ and subtracting that from one previous of $a$, $a - 1$.">
    The formula to compute the sum of elements in the subarray from $[a, b]$ using the prefix sum array is `prefix`[<FITBBlank correctAnswer="b"/>] $-$ `prefix`[<FITBBlank correctAnswer="a-1"/>].
