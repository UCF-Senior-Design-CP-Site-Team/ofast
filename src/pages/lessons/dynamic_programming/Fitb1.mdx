<FITBBlock question="Alice and Bob are playing a game. In this game, Alice starts off with 2 pieces of chocolate. She is going to magically double the amount of chocolate she has and give it all to Bob. Bob is then going to eat 1 piece of chocolate and give the remaining pieces back to Alice so that she can repeat this process. Determine how many pieces of chocolate Alice will have after $n$ iterations of this process.  If n is 0: $f(n) = 2$  If n > 0: $f(n) = {2*f(n-1)} - 1$." />
